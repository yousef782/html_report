 <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,<br> object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.<br> It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),<br> meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br> Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on<br> any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.<br> The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.<br> As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub<br>, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
